\section{Conclusion}

After definition of possible approaches, all what is left is to pick one or
several and compare them. We have models, metrics and the plan for obtaining
the dataset.

We have to solve the issue with computational power, either using colab or
kaggle.

Finally, we have to seemlessly integrate all the parts of the work locally, to
make a uniform architecture capable of solving assignment. But for importantly,
representing final product ready for deployment and presentation.
