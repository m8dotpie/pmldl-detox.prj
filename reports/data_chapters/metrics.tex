\section{Metrics}

\subsection{Toxicity}

To objectively compare the performance of the models in text detoxification we
need some toxicity metric. As such, we are going to use
\textbf{\textit{Detoxify}} package~\cite{}.

Each model predictions will be ranked in the interval \([0, 1]\) for further
comparison.

\subsubsection{Semantic similarity}

Since we have a task of translation (style change) with preservation of the
meaning, we might want to use some related metrics. Generally, we have decided
to stick with metrics introduced in initial draft.

Final results will be compared using the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BLEU
    \item METEOR
    \item Cosine Similarity (GLoVe embedded)
\end{itemize}
